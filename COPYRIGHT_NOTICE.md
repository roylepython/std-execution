## 🛡️ Standing Against Disability Discrimination

### An Open Letter to the Technology Community

From: D Hargreaves AKA Roylepython, Yorkshire Champion
Date: August 26, 2025
Re: Protecting Disabled Individuals in Technology

---

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing this open letter to address the systematic discrimination against disabled individuals in the technology sector, particularly by platforms that claim to support innovation and community while actively discriminating against those with protected characteristics.

The Reality of Disability Discrimination

As a disabled developer who has faced discrimination firsthand, I have witnessed:

1. **Kickstarter** terminating campaigns and accounts of disabled creators without consideration for their conditions
2. **WebHostingTalk** banning disabled members who require reasonable adjustments in communication
3. **Technology platforms** failing to provide basic accessibility features
4. **Communities** ostracizing members who disclose disabilities
5. **Companies** refusing to make reasonable adjustments as required by law

This Must Stop

The technology industry prides itself on innovation, disruption, and changing the world. Yet it systematically excludes approximately 15% of the global population - over 1 billion disabled individuals.

Legal Framework

Under the UK Equality Act 2010 and similar legislation worldwide:

- **Disability is a protected characteristic**
- **Reasonable adjustments MUST be provided**
- **Discrimination is ILLEGAL**
- **Failure to accommodate is discrimination**
- **"Disability" includes physical, mental, and neurodivergent conditions**
